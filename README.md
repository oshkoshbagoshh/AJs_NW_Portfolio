## Description
<!-- 
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide: -->
<!-- 
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn? -->

This will be a working portfolio, where I can continuously add the projects I complete while at Northwestern's bootcamp. The motivation for this project was to create a living portfolio, and as such, there will be continous updates as my strength as a Web Developer increases. 

I utilized basic HTML, CSS, and markdown for the documentation.

I also utilized wireframing to copy the structure of an example page that was supplied to us.

## Installation

To install the project (or use something similar), all a user would need is Git, HTML, CSS, and Markdown. 

## Usage

Here is a screenshot of what the page will look like: 

![preview](files/Develop/assets/images/preview.png)
<!-- Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax: -->
<!-- 
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ``` -->

 ## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

<!-- ## How to Contribute


If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer. -->

<!-- ## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
