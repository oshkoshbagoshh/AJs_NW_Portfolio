This will be a portfolio, showcasing the projects I work on while at Northwestern's Bootcamp.

This will be a working portfolio, where I can continuously add the projects I complete while at Northwestern's bootcamp. The motivation for this project was to create a living portfolio, and as such, there will be continous updates as my strength as a Web Developer increases. 

I utilized basic HTML, CSS, and markdown for the documentation.

I also utilized wireframing to copy the structure of an example page that was supplied to us.
