## Grader Feedback
Hello Aj, Thank you for this submission of Challenge 2, your first Professional Portfolio. You were able to submit a link to your GitHub repository, but you did not submit a link to your deployed application at: https://oshkoshbagoshh.github.io/AJs_NW_Portfolio/ 

Please make sure that you are submitting all the required items for Challenges as they will change throughout the BootCamp.

* Your README.md contains a brief description and a screenshot, but does not contain the deployed link mentioned above. 
 
 * Your Portfolio contains your name in navbar at the top and links to various sections in your profile, but as you've noted these links currently do not possess functionality. 
 

 
 * To understand this relationship better you can revisit Challenge 1 and see how the hrefs of the navlinks in that application corresponded to the specific ids on the related elements. 


 
 * You were required to have 1 large image that redirected to one of your existing repositories as well as additional placeholders. You have a few large placeholder images that are not properly sized and then a list of links to various applications on the web. 
 
In terms of mobile responsiveness you did very well aside from the sizing of the placeholder images that overflowed the page's y axis. Please remember to utilize your tutor, AskBCS and office hours when completing these Challenges. The focus on each of these Challenges is to put the material from the week prior into practice; you may struggle at times to understand certain concepts just as I myself did, but if you commit the time and utilize the resources then at the end of the BootCamp you will come away a sufficient programmer. I wish you best of luck in the BootCamp! - Central Grader JC
